## INITIAL DESIGN
*   My initial idea for this project was to create a informative website about the Greek Gods. My target audience is anyone who is interested in Greek Mythology,
    this can cover a huge spectrum on ages, genders and interest levels from children who want to learn about the Greek Gods, use the site for school projects to the educated who just want to read something 
    fun and interesting.

* The main features that I wanted to include are:
    
    * Easy to use navigation menu.
    * Easy to read information.
    * A black and gold colour scheme that stands out but is not over powering.

## USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

I designed this site to provide information and content that can be helpful to a wide range of age groups.

The structure of the site was designed to be simple and easy to use and have a good content balance as to not
overload the user and give them enough information as not leave them lost or needing more knowledge.

* The website is for the following users types:
    
    * Users that has no previous knowledge of the stories, history, characters and see what they used to look like.
    * Users with basic knowledge of the Greek history but were looking for more information and increase their knowledge base.
    * Users who have good knowledge of the Greek history but want to refresh the knowledge or do some research or even just enjoy reading about the history of all the gods.

## USER STORIES

#### CLIENT GOALS

* The site needs to be easily accessible.
* The navigation menu to be simple to use from desktop to smaller devices.
* Manouvering around the site to be simple and straightforward.
* For the site to be informative, easy to read and see the images clearly.

#### FIRST TIME VISITORS

## WIREFRAMES

## FEATURES

* The following is the Features that I have used for my project.    
    
    * Hover feature which tells the user what location the mouse is in while in the menu.
    * simple function so that they user does not lose its place in the means and get confused.
    * Contact form validates and requests the user to input information in the input boxes and textarea.
    * this stops the user from accidently sending blank or incomplete contact details and information needed.    

## SOLVED BUGS

* All my background images didnt fit on the screen properly as a result I changed the background-position from `background-position: center center;` to `background-position: top center;`
