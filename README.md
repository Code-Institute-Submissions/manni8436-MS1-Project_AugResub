# MS1-Project - Legend Of The Greek Gods

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

This project is about the of the Greek Gods and explaining 
the history and what happened over the years from day one and a brief
explaination of each god which will help people understand who they were 
and how they came to be one of the most favourite mythologies around to 
even the present time and this is also my favourite mythology 


(UX- User Experience)

Use this section to write the idea behind the website and explaining the idea 
behind the website and what is the idea/purpose behind the website,

also what age range this website is for and what they will be using it for and 
what will be the end result for them.




(User Stories/ use this as part of the UX)

also in this section add any links to wireframes, mockups, diagrams or anything that 
was used in the design process of the website.

(wireframes)

After careful planning and a lot of adding, editing, removing i finally made a
wireframe that I was happy with and was my final work for the website




(Features)

In this section go over different sections of the project and describe the features and what it does.

you may also discuss plans for additional features to be added in the future.



(Technologies Used)

In this project I have used HTML5 to design the way the content looks 
and I also used CSS3 to design the style for the website and make it look pleasing to the eye 
for the users.


write here all other technologies that was used while making the website.




(Bugs)
    My first bug was during when I was doing the dropdown menu because 
    was white border around the outside of my menu items and I tried loads 
    of different ways to resolve it with no luck until I inspected the pages 
    and found out that there was padding in the dropdown-menu section that 
    shouldnt have been there and I selected the class tag in CSS3 and 
    added padding attribute with the value of 0 which resolved the issue



(testing)

In this section write about all the tests you have done to make sure 
the webiste works and meets the requirements that is needed from the
users.

and also you will want to go over all of your user stories 
from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, 
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way 
for the users to achieve their goals.


in addition talk about how your project look on different browsers 
and screen sizes and also add in this section if there was any very 
interesting bugs or problems that was discovered along the way even 
if you havent addressed them yet.

(Deployment)

In this section describe all the steps that was taken to deploy the 
project to the hosting platform that was used.

In particular you should provide all details on the differences 
between the development version and the deployed version and include
any different branches, configurations and environnment variables.

and also, just incase it isnt obvious then describe how to run the
code locally.

I chose one that best suited the layout and structure of my website and 
I got it from the website below and designed it to the best to complete 
the navbar of the page for mobile first which now has been put in place 
and works well in each sections of the menu
