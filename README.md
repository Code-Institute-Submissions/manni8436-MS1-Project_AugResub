# MS1-Project - Legend Of The Greek Gods

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

This project is about the Greek Gods

explaining the history and what happened over the years from day one and a brief
explaination of each god which will help people understand who they were 
and how they came to be one of the most favourite mythologies around to 
even the present time and this is also my favourite mythology with a brief
talk about the connection between the Greek and the Roman gods and how they 
connected


(UX- User Experience)

Use this section to write the idea behind the website and explaining the idea 
behind the website and what is the idea/purpose behind the website,

also what age range this website is for and what they will be using it for and 
what will be the end result for them.




(User Stories/ use this as part of the UX)

also in this section add any links to wireframes, mockups, diagrams or anything that 
was used in the design process of the website.

(wireframes)

After carefully planning and a lot of adding, removing and editing I finally made a
wireframe that I was happy with and was my final work for the website




(Features)

In this section go over different sections of the project and describe the features and what it does
you may also discuss plans for additional features to be added in the future



(Technologies Used)

In this project I have used the following technologies below

HTML5
CSS3 
Bootstrap 

write here all other technologies that was used while making the website




(Bugs)
    My first bug was during when I was doing the dropdown menu because 
    was white border around the outside of my menu items and I tried loads 
    of different ways to resolve it with no luck until I inspected the pages 
    and found out that there was padding in the dropdown-menu section that 
    shouldnt have been there and I selected the class tag in CSS3 and 
    added padding attribute with the value of 0 which resolved the issue

    I also have noticed that my dropdown menu seems to be abit to far to the 
    right on where it should be and i have tried to fix it before but with no 
    luck yet but i will fix it at a later date

    I have noticed that for some reason the image doesnt load up in the 
    deployed site on GitHub Pages which I will try to fix at a later date


(testing)

In this section write about all the tests you have done to make sure 
the webiste works and meets the requirements that is needed from the
users.

and also you will want to go over all of your user stories 
from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, 
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way 
for the users to achieve their goals.


in addition talk about how your project look on different browsers 
and screen sizes and also add in this section if there was any very 
interesting bugs or problems that was discovered along the way even 
if you havent addressed them yet.

(Deployment)

In this section describe all the steps that was taken to deploy the 
project to the hosting platform that was used.

In particular you should provide all details on the differences 
between the development version and the deployed version and include
any different branches, configurations and environnment variables.

and also, just incase it isnt obvious then describe how to run the
code locally.

(Credit)

I chose one this layout which best suited the structure of my website and I used
bootstrap to aid me in making the dropdown menu at the same time I had to change 
colours and the way it looks so that it would match my website and have it the way 
I wanted which was used as a mobile first approach 

which has now been put in place and works well in each sections of the menu

I have attached the link below that I used to make the dropdown menu 

(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/dropdowns/) 

I used a few icons from the Font Awesome website in this project for the links 
in my footer nav and I have attached below the links to each icon I used

https://fontawesome.com/icons/facebook-square?style=brands
https://fontawesome.com/icons/instagram?style=brands
https://fontawesome.com/icons/linkedin-in?style=brands
https://fontawesome.com/icons/copyright?style=regular

I done some research online as what content to us in my project,

I used the link below to use a small section to find out when
the mythology of the Greek Gods started

https://www.history.com/.amp/topics/ancient-history/greek-mythology



In here you thank all the people that have helped you in the course
and also all the places that you used icons, links etc.. from.

(Acknowledgements)

Most of the designs and layout for my project was created on my own 
using wireframes but I also used bootstrap to aid me in building a few section
sections of my website

I also used Font Awesome for the icons on my website


In this section write about where you got the inspiratioin from 
to make design your website.
