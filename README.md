One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

This project is about the Greek Gods

explaining the history and what happened over the years from day one to the
present time

also a brief explaination of each god which will help people understand who they were 
and how they came to be one of the most favourite mythologies around to 
even the present time also speaking about the less famoues gods that nobody has heard
off and also a brief talk about the connection between the Greek and the Roman gods 
and how they connected and why the same gods have different names


(UX- User Experience)

Use this section to write the idea behind the website and explaining the idea 
behind the website and what is the idea/purpose behind the website,

also what age range this website is for and what they will be using it for and 
what will be the end result for them.

The age range for this webiste is between the ages of 7yrs old school children
through to secondary school children and to anyone who is in higher education 
and finally to 70yrs old + that are highly interesting  in Greek Mythology


(User Stories/ use this as part of the UX)

also in this section add any links to wireframes, mockups, diagrams or anything that 
was used in the design process of the website.

(wireframes)

After carefully planning and a lot of adding, removing and editing I finally made a
wireframe that I was happy with and was my final work for the website




(Features)

In this section go over different sections of the project and describe the features and what it does
you may also discuss plans for additional features to be added in the future



(Technologies Used)

In this project I have used the following technologies below

HTML5
CSS3 
Bootstrap 

write here all other technologies that was used while making the website




(Bugs)
* = needs to be resolved 

    My first bug was during when I was doing the dropdown menu because 
    was white border around the outside of my menu items and I tried loads 
    of different ways to resolve it with no luck until I inspected the pages 
    and found out that there was padding in the dropdown-menu section that 
    shouldnt have been there and I selected the class tag in CSS3 and 
    added padding attribute with the value of 0 which resolved the issue

    * I noticed that my dropdown menu seems to be abit to far to the right 
      on where it should be and i have tried to fix it before but with no 
      luck yet

    I have noticed that for the image wasnt loading on my deployed site with GitHub Pages 
    but I have managed to fix the issue by changing the file path from the one I had there 
    orignally that I copied from the image location on image to the correct file path that 
    is from assets/css/images/ and finally to the image jpg path that was needed to correct 
    the issue

    I now have noticed that my social links have stopped working when I click on 
    them but now I have changed the linked and redone the coding for the social media that 
    is in my footer

    I have a hover affect on a image to make it bigger when you hover over it to be seen 
    bigger when you want but the position is off as you cant see the image properly as it 
    is to far in one direction but I have resolved it now by using position absolute and 
    positioned it in a good place so that it can be seen clearly

    I had a issue with enlarging my images on the lesser known gods but I tried to do it 
    again by only selecting the img top class and it worked

    * I saw on my deployed that the icons are alot smaller when it is viewed on a samsung
    device which I more then likely have to use media queires to resolve this issue

(testing)

In this section write about all the tests you have done to make sure 
the webiste works and meets the requirements that is needed from the
users.

and also you will want to go over all of your user stories 
from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, 
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way 
for the users to achieve their goals.


in addition talk about how your project look on different browsers 
and screen sizes and also add in this section if there was any very 
interesting bugs or problems that was discovered along the way even 
if you havent addressed them yet.

(Deployment)

In this section describe all the steps that was taken to deploy the 
project to the hosting platform that was used.

In particular you should provide all details on the differences 
between the development version and the deployed version and include
any different branches, configurations and environnment variables.

and also, just incase it isnt obvious then describe how to run the
code locally.

(Credit)

I chose one this layout which best suited the structure of my website and I used
bootstrap to aid me in making the dropdown menu at the same time I had to change 
colours and the way it looks so that it would match my website and have it the way 
I wanted which was used as a mobile first approach 

which has now been put in place and works well in each sections of the menu

I have attached the link below that I used to make the dropdown menu 

(https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/dropdowns/) 

I used a few icons from the Font Awesome website in this project for the links 
in my footer nav and I have attached below the links to each icon I used

https://fontawesome.com/icons/facebook-square?style=brands
https://fontawesome.com/icons/instagram?style=brands
https://fontawesome.com/icons/linkedin-in?style=brands
https://fontawesome.com/icons/copyright?style=regular


In here you thank all the people that have helped you in the course
and also all the places that you used icons, links etc.. from.

(Acknowledgements)

My inspiration is my passion for Greek Mythology which I have enjoyed 
and loved reading about it for a long time and I even have Greek Mythology
memobrilia from my trip to Greece and Rome

Most of the designs and layout for my project was created on my own 
using wireframes but I also used bootstrap to aid me in building my navigation
menu and also the image cards

I also want to thank the following websites for helping me with my first project 

thank you hover.css, fontawesome, ColorSpace, Google Fonts as all of them helped me 
design my website

In this section write about where you got the inspiratioin from 
to make design your website.
