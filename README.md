[Here is a link to the final project](https://manni8436.github.io/MS1-Project/)

For this Milestone Project we were given a few options to choose from however I decided to create a website 
about the Greek Gods, which I included pictures, a contacts page and links to different social media platforms.

I decided to create a website about the Greek Gods due to my passion for Greek Mythology and I felt that I would
produce a better website due to my interest in the subject.

## CONTENT 

## USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

I designed this site to provide information and content that can be helpful to a wide range of age groups.

The structure of the site was designed to be simple and easy to use and have a good content balance as to not
overload the user and give them enough information as not leave them lost or needing more knowledge.

* The website is for the following users types:
    
    * Users that has no previous knowledge of the stories, history, characters and see what they used to look like.
    * Users with basic knowledge of the Greek history but were looking for more information and increase their knowledge base.
    * Users who have good knowledge of the Greek history but want to refresh the knowledge or do some research or even just enjoy reading about the history of all the gods.

## WIREFRAMES

[Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet for this project](assets/wireframes/MSProject1Wireframes.pdf)

## FEATURES

* The following is the Features that I have used for my project.    
    
    * Hover feature which tells the user what location the mouse is in while in the menu.
    * simple function so that they user does not lose its place in the means and get confused.
    * Contact form validates and requests the user to input information in the input boxes and textarea.
    * this stops the user from accidently sending blank or incomplete contact details and information needed.    

## TESTING

I tested my site to insure all aspects of my site works and be consitent throughtout the website as excepted 
for both desktop and mobile versions.

* This includes:

    * Making sure all pages are responsive and all contents legible.
    * Testing that the navbar changes to a dropdown menu as excepted on all pages, collapsing at 991px as excepted.
    * all webpages was check on major desktop and mobile platforms listed below:
        * Chrome
        * Firefox
        * Safari

A testing page has been made using MS Excel which can be found <a href="Test Page (MS1 Project).xlsx">here.</a> 
It details all the test taken to ensure the site works consitently across all devices.

## SOLVED BUGS
