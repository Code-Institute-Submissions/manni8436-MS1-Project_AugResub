[Here is a link to the final project](https://manni8436.github.io/MS1-Project/)

For this Milestone Project we were given a few options to choose from however I decided to create a website 
about the Greek Gods, which I included pictures, a contacts page and links to different social media platforms.

I decided to create a website about the Greek Gods due to my passion for Greek Mythology and I felt that I would
produce a better website due to my interest in the subject.

## CONTENT 


## USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

I designed this site to provide information and content that can be helpful to a wide range of age groups.

the structure of the site was designed to be simple and easy to use and have a good content balance as to not
overload the user and give them enough information as not leave them lost or needing more knowledge.

### the website is for the following users types:
    
    1.1 Users that has no previous knowledge of the stories, history, characters and see what they 
        used to look like.

    1.2 Users with basic knowledge of the Greek history but were looking for more information and
        increase their knowledge base.

    1.3 Users who have good knowledge of the Greek history but want to refresh the knowledge or 
        do some research or even just enjoy reading about the history of all the gods.

Balsamiq wireframes was used to create my website for each page for desktop and mobile devices which has been 
added into my repository, however while designing my website I have had to make changes of the process to make the 
site more responsive and user friendly and may not match completely with my wireframes.

## WIREFRAMES

in the early stage of the designing process some wireframes were made and have been added to my repository and it can also be viewed by clicking <a href="MSProject1.pdf">here</a>

## FEATURES

### The following is the Features that I have used for my project.

    2.1 Hover feature which tells the user what location the mouse is in while in the menu.
        * simple function so that they user does not lose its place in the means and get confused.

    2.2 Contact form validates and requests the user to input information in the input boxes and textarea.
        * this stops the user from accidently sending blank or incomplete contact details and 
          information needed.    

## TESTING

I tested my site to insure all aspects of my site works and be consitent throughtout the website as excepted 
for both desktop and mobile versions.

### This includes:

        3.1 Making sure all pages are responsive and all contents legible.
    
        3.2 Testing that the navbar changes to a dropdown menu as excepted on all pages, collapsing at 
        991px as excepted.
    
        3.3 all webpages was check on major desktop and mobile platforms listed below:
            * Chrome
            * Firefox
            * Safari

        3.4 Noted Issues
            * Background image on home page (index.html) seems to cut off at the top of the page.

A testing page has been made using MS Excel which can be found <a href="Test Page (MS1 Project).xlsx">here.</a> 
It details all the test taken to ensure the site works consitently across all devices.
