Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development 

# MS1-Project - Legend Of The Greek Gods

For this Milestone Project we were given a few options to choose from however I decided to create a website 
about the Greek Gods, which I included pictures, a contacts page and links to different social media platforms.

I decided to create a webiste about the Greek Gods was due to my passion for Greek Mythology which I felt that 
I could make a better website due to my interests and passion for it.

User Experience

I designed this site to provide information and content that can be helpful to a wide range of age groups.

the structure of the site was designed to be simple and easy to use and have a good content balance as to not
overload the user and give them enough information as not leave them lost or needing more knowledge.

the website is for the following users types:
    
    ** Users has no previous knowledge of the stories, history, characters and see what they used to look like

    ** Users with basic knowledge of the Greek history but were looking for more information and
    increase their knowledge base

    ** Users who have good knowledge of the Greek history but want to refresh the knowledge or do some research 
    or even just enjoy reading about the history of all the gods.

Balsamiq wireframes was used to create my website for each page for desktop and mobile devices which has been 
added into my repository, however while designing my website I have had to make changes of the process to make the 
site more responsive and user friendly and may not match completely with my wireframes.

Features

The following is the Features that I have used for my project.

* Hover feature which tells the user what location the mouse is in while in the menu.
    ** simple function so that they user does not lose its place in the means and get confused.

* Contact form validates and requests the user to input information in the input boxes and textarea
    ** this stops the user from accidently sending blank or incomplete contact details and information needed.    

(testing)

I tested my site to insure all aspects of my site works and be consitent throughtout the website as excepted 
for both desktop and mobile versions.

This includes:
    * Making sure all elements are responsive and all contents legible.
    
    * Testing that the navbar changes to a dropdown menu as excepted on all pages, collapsing to dropdown menu 
    at 991px as excepted with media Queries from bootstrap.
    
    * The website was check on a few major desktop and mobile platform below :
        ** Chrome
        ** Firefox
        ** Safari

A testing page has been made to make sure all aspects of my website work and also to keep track of what was tested and the results 
which the test page has been added to the repository.









(Technologies Used)

In this project I have used the following technologies below

HTML5
CSS3 
Media Queries
Bootstrap 

write here all other technologies that was used while making the website

(Bugs)
* = needs to be resolved 
    
    I couldnt change the colour of my toggler icon in the start but I have managed to find the tag that
    would allow me to change the colour of my toggler icon

    my dropdown menu isnt working and wont dropdown at the moment but I have managed to fix it by changing
    the whole menu coding and now it works perfectly and is responsive

    I couldnt change the colour of my navbar due to not being able to isolate the correct class selector 
    but I have managed to find what class tag and changed the colour

    while I was making a box to go over my nav menu the text colour of all the text except home dont change
    to my colour of choice at the moment but since I removed the search box component from my navbar the 
    box around the menu works now

    my index.html (home page), the big three, lesser known gods, history and contact us pages have the text 
    and image getting cut off at the bottom and doesnt change even if I change the position and this was 
    because I didnt have a footer tags and once I changed it and then the content was no longer covered

    * the background image are responsive apart from when you get to the lower breakpoint 576 pixels 
    because the part of where zeus is in the image gets cut off

    my background images were not appearing on my deployed site not I was not using the relative file path at
    the time and I have now change all the files paths and all background images work and show up on my deployed site

    the content on the home page cant be seen properly due to the background image but I wrapped the content in a 
    box border with a black background while using opacity for it not to be blocking the background image as much

    * need to change the spacing between the lesser known gods images as they are to close together in the 
    breakpoint of 992px and 768px


(Deployment)

In this section describe all the steps that was taken to deploy the 
project to the hosting platform that was used.

In particular you should provide all details on the differences 
between the development version and the deployed version and include
any different branches, configurations and environnment variables.

and also, just incase it isnt obvious then describe how to run the
code locally.

(Credit)

I chose one this layout which best suited the structure of my website and I used
bootstrap to aid me in making the dropdown menu at the same time I had to change 
colours and the way it looks so that it would match my website and have it the way 
I wanted which was used as a mobile first approach 

which has now been put in place and works well in each sections of the menu

(Acknowledgements)

My inspiration is my passion for Greek Mythology which I have enjoyed 
and loved reading about it for a long time and I even have Greek Mythology
memobrilia from my trip to Greece and Rome

Most of the designs and layout for my project was created on my own using 
wireframes and I also used bootstrap to aid me in building my navigation
menu and also the image cards

I also want to thank the following websites for helping me with my first project 

thank you hover.css, fontawesome, ColorSpace, Google Fonts as all of them helped me 
design my website
