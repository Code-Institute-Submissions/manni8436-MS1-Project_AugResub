# MS1-Project - Legend Of The Greek Gods

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

My first project is about the Greek Gods

explaining the history and what happened over the years from day one to the
present time

also a brief explanation of each god which will help people understand who they were 
and how they came to be one of the most favourite mythologies around to even the very 
present times we are in and I will also speaking about the less famous gods that people may
have never heard off before and also a brief talk about the connection between the Greek and the Roman gods 
and how they connected and why the same gods have different names


(UX- User Experience)

Use this section to write the idea behind the website and explaining the idea 
behind the website and what is the idea/purpose behind the website,

also what age range this website is for and what they will be using it for and 
what will be the end result for them.


The age range for my website is between the ages of 7yrs old school children
through to secondary school children to anyone who is in higher education to 
anyone working or studying the Greek Mythology and finally to 70yrs old or 
anyone who are highly interesting in Greek Mythology


(User Stories/ use this as part of the UX)

also in this section add any links to wireframes, mockups, diagrams or anything that 
was used in the design process of the website.

(wireframes)

After careful planning and a lot of adding, removing and editing I finally made a
wireframe that I was happy with and was my final work for the website which I have 
added to the github repository as a PDF file but from the initial design of my wireframes
but I have had to change the way that my website has looked for the more functionality of the 
site and to make it look better also the responsiveness wasnt working so I also had to redo 
all the navbar and bottom nav using bootstrap to aid me to do this


(Features)

In this section go over different sections of the project and describe the features and what it does
you may also discuss plans for additional features to be added in the future

(Technologies Used)

In this project I have used the following technologies below

HTML5
CSS3 
Media Queries
Bootstrap 

write here all other technologies that was used while making the website




(Bugs)
* = needs to be resolved 
    
    I couldnt change the colour of my toggler icon in the start but I have managed to find the tag that
    would allow me to change the colour of my toggler icon

    my dropdown menu isnt working and wont dropdown at the moment but I have managed to fix it by changing
    the whole menu coding and now it works perfectly and is responsive

    I couldnt change the colour of my navbar due to not being able to isolate the correct class selector 
    but I have managed to find what class tag and changed the colour

    while I was making a box to go over my nav menu the text colour of all the text except home dont change
    to my colour of choice at the moment but since I removed the search box component from my navbar the 
    box around the menu works now

    my index.html (home page), the big three, lesser known gods, history and contact us pages have the text 
    and image getting cut off at the bottom and doesnt change even if I change the position and this was 
    because I didnt have a footer tags and once I changed it and then the content was no longer covered

    * the background image are responsive apart from when you get to the lower breakpoint 576 pixels 
    because the part of where zeus is in the image gets cut off

    * my background images do not appear on my deployed site

    * the content on the home page cant be seen properly due to the background image

    * need to change the spacing between the lesser known gods images as they are to close together in the 
    breakpoint of 992px and 768px

(testing)

In this section write about all the tests you have done to make sure 
the website works and meets the requirements that is needed from the
users.

and also you will want to go over all of your user stories 
from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, 
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way 
for the users to achieve their goals.


in addition talk about how your project look on different browsers 
and screen sizes and also add in this section if there was any very 
interesting bugs or problems that was discovered along the way even 
if you havent addressed them yet.

(Deployment)

In this section describe all the steps that was taken to deploy the 
project to the hosting platform that was used.

In particular you should provide all details on the differences 
between the development version and the deployed version and include
any different branches, configurations and environnment variables.

and also, just incase it isnt obvious then describe how to run the
code locally.

(Credit)

I chose one this layout which best suited the structure of my website and I used
bootstrap to aid me in making the dropdown menu at the same time I had to change 
colours and the way it looks so that it would match my website and have it the way 
I wanted which was used as a mobile first approach 

which has now been put in place and works well in each sections of the menu

I have attached the link below that I used to help me credit sections of my website

(Acknowledgements)

My inspiration is my passion for Greek Mythology which I have enjoyed 
and loved reading about it for a long time and I even have Greek Mythology
memobrilia from my trip to Greece and Rome

Most of the designs and layout for my project was created on my own using 
wireframes and I also used bootstrap to aid me in building my navigation
menu and also the image cards

I also want to thank the following websites for helping me with my first project 

thank you hover.css, fontawesome, ColorSpace, Google Fonts as all of them helped me 
design my website
